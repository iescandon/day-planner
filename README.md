## Description 

This website is designed as an application to quiz the user on their knowledge of coding. User goes through the quiz by clicking on buttons and submits their results using a form. As soon as quiz has been initiated timer is counting down and scores are being kept. If user gets an answer correctly they get points added to their score. If the user gets an answer incorrect they lose 5 seconds off of their time. The user is informed of whether their answer was correct or incorrect. If the user was incorrect they are also informed of which answer was the correct answer. Results are displayed at the end of the quiz or when time runs out. User types their initials and their initials and scores are then stored into local storage. Local storage can be cleared. HTML and CSS is designed to be make the application easy to use and understand.
