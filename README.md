## Description 

This website is designed to function as an interactive day planner. It allows the user to plan their day by simply typing in the hour block and clicking the save button. The information gets saved and set back into the local page with help from local storage. CSS classes and JS help keep the current hour red, the past hours grey, and the future hours green. Current date is being displayed at the top of the page. Clear button is provided at the top to help clear the planner.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
